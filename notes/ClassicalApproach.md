The Classical Approach is the **oldest approach** to probability theory. It is one of the four primary approaches typically discussed in a probability course.

It provides a simple and widely understood method for measuring uncertainty in numbers.

### Prerequisites for Application

The Classical Approach can only be applied if the outcomes of a random experiment meet three strict requirements:

1.  **Finite in Number:** The number of possible outcomes in the sample space must be countable.
2.  **Mutually Exclusive:** The happening of any one outcome must prevent the happening of any other outcome (they cannot occur simultaneously).
3.  For instance, in a single coin toss, a head and a tail are mutually exclusive.
4.  **Equally Likely:** The chance of each outcome occurring must be the same, meaning there is no reason to expect one outcome over any other.

If any of these three requirements are not satisfied, the Classical Approach will not work, and other methods (like the Relative Frequency or Axiomatic approaches) must be used.

### The Classical Definition

Assuming the conditions above are met, the probability $\mathcal{P}(E)$ of an event $E$ is defined by comparing the outcomes that favor the event to the total number of possible outcomes (exhaustive cases).

If the sample space $\Omega$ contains $n$ total exhaustive cases, and the event $E$ has $m$ favorable outcomes, the formula is:

$$\mathcal{P}(E) = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes for event E}}{\text{Number of exhaustive cases}}$$

For example, when tossing two fair coins, the sample space is $\Omega=\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$, so $n=4$. 
If the event $E$ is "getting at least one head," then $E=\{HH, HT, TH\}$, so $m=3$. The probability $\mathcal{P}(E)$ is $\frac{3}{4}$, or $75\%$.

To check your understanding of its limitations: 

If you were calculating the probability of a randomly selected person being over 6 feet tall, 
which of the three prerequisites (finite, mutually exclusive, equally likely) would be most difficult to satisfy, 
making the Classical Approach unsuitable?
