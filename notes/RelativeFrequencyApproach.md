The Relative Frequency Approach (RFA) is a critical method for measuring uncertainty when the outcomes of an experiment are not necessarily symmetrical or equally likely.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the Relative Frequency Approach and the related Statistical Approach:

### 1. Necessity and Prerequisites

The Relative Frequency Approach (RFA) is one of the four general approaches to probability. It is applied in situations where the requirements of the Classical Approach cannot be met.

*   **Key Difference from Classical:** The RFA is necessary because it does not demand the requirement of **equally likely cases**.
*   **Retained Requirements:** Like the Classical Approach, the RFA still requires that the total number of outcomes be **finite and mutually exclusive**.

### 2. Core Principle (Using Recorded Data)

The RFA is essentially related to **estimating probabilities from a given frequency distribution**.

1.  **Data Collection:** It relies on recorded data, which may be secondary or primary.
2.  **Frequency Distribution:** If a variable $X$ takes values $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ with absolute frequencies $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$, the total number of observations is $N = \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_i$.
3.  **Calculation:** The **relative frequency** for a value $X_i$ is calculated as the ratio $\frac{f_i}{N}$.
4.  **Estimation:** Obtaining probabilities using this recorded data is known as the Relative Frequency Approach.
    When doing this, one assumes that the available frequency distribution data is representative of the underlying population, which associates randomness with the estimation.

These relative frequencies share key properties with any valid probability distribution:
*   They are non-negative: $\frac{f_{i}}{N}\ge0$.
*   Their sum is one: $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{f_{i}}{N}=1$.

### 3. The Statistical Approach (Formal Limit)

The Statistical Approach is a formal mathematical extension related to the RFA.

This approach assumes that an experiment is feasible to repeat a large number of times, $n$ (where $n$ mathematically means $n\rightarrow\infty$) under identical conditions,.

The probability of an event $E$ is then defined as the value to which the following limit converges,:

$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{n}$$

where $m$ is the frequency of the event $E$ occurring out of $n$ trials,.

For example, if you toss a fair coin $n$ times, the limit of the number of heads ($m$) divided by $n$ will converge to $1/2$ as $n$ approaches infinity ($\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{n}\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}$).

To check your understanding of where the RFA is applicable:

If you wanted to calculate the probability of a specific, 
 rare historical event (like a specific volcano erupting 500 years ago) occurring again next year, 
 why would the Relative Frequency Approach be unsuitable?
