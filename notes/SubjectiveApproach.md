That is a perfect request. A detailed explanation of the Subjective Approach is key to rounding out the discussion of probability fundamentals.

Here is a detailed summary of the Subjective Approach to probability theory, suitable for inclusion in your article:

### Subjective Approach

The Subjective Approach to probability theory is one of the four main methods used to measure uncertainty in numbers.

This approach is employed in situations where neither the requirements of the Classical Approach nor the Relative Frequency Approach can be satisfied.

**Core Principle:**

In the Subjective Approach, the probability of an event is based entirely on the **experience, wisdom, intuition, perception, expertise, and belief** of a particular individual.

**Interpretation:**

The resulting probability is interpreted as a **measure of the degree of belief** or the quantified judgment of that individual regarding the likelihood of the event occurring.

**When It Is Applicable:**

This approach is applicable in scenarios where events either **do not occur at all** or **occur only once**, or cannot be performed repeatedly under the same conditions (i.e., experiments are not repeatable).

**Examples:**

For instance, a teacher might express their confidence that the probability of a specific student achieving the first position on a test is $0.99$, or that the probability of a student failing the test is $0.05$. These assessments are rooted in the teacher's personal beliefs and past experience.

**Key Limitation:**

A major drawback of this approach is its inherent subjectivity. Since the assessment is purely subjective, the resulting probability will **vary from person to person**, 
depending on each individual's perception of the situation and their biases or prejudices, even if they share the same background knowledge.
